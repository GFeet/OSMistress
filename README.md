# OSMistress

## About

This NSFW project is a "web" application focused on moddability and offline use.

## Usage

To download the application, either clone the repository or download the contents. After you extract the source code, you need to [get the content](#getting-content), since that cannot be distributed on GitHub.

## Getting Content

There is currently no way to obtain the image resources and other material for the application to run properly.

**This will be added soon...**

## Modding Guide

## Submitting your mod

* To submit your mod, you need to create a pull request with your mod's .js file in the proper directory.

**This system is still in development and will most likely change...**
